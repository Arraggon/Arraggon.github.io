    <h2>SONNET 2: When forty winters shall besiege thy brow</h2>
    <br>
    <p>When forty winter shall besiege thy brow</p>
    <p>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</p>
    <p>Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,</p>
    <p>Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Then being asked where all thy beauty lies--</p>
    <p>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days--</p>
    <p>To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes</p>
    <p>Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.</p>
    <br>
    <p>How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use</p>
    <p>If thou couldst answer "This fair child of mine</p>
    <p>shall sum my count and make my old excuse",</p>
    <p>Proving his beauty by succession thine.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This were to be new made when thou art old,</p>
    <p>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</p>
